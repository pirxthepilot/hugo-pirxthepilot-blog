I spent too much time working on this track. Exploring the new module, the [Morphagene](http://www.makenoisemusic.com/modules/morphagene) took almost a week. The rest of the patch came together in a day or two, while several more days were spent pondering on the right take to use, mastering things, listening and re-listening.

Reminder: I shouldn't spend too much time one one thing.

In any case, I am quite pleased with the results.
