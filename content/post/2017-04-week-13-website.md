+++
Spent the entire last week (and this week as well, so far) making a totally new **modulogeek.com** website. As with this blog, I am making it with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), and basing it on the [Creative Theme](https://github.com/digitalcraftsman/hugo-creative-theme). There isn't much in the way of media or links to show, as the site is still in progress, and I haven't put it online yet. Perhaps this week..

Making the new site has been more challenging than making this blog, which was mostly a straightforward theme with minimal customizations. The past week I have learned (more than I was willing to) more javascript, css, responsive, etc. etc. Can't say I'm a fan of this kind of project, but I'm happy with the results. And, mercifully, it is far from the website design frustrations of the early 2000s. Thank you, progress!
