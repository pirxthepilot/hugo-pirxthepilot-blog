+++
First, I started working on the  actual track for "Puzzle Girl" - the song I was patching the modular for the past couple of weeks. It's far from finished, but I managed to record a lot, and layout a rough arrangement for the first half of the song. I think I'll leave it at that state and just come back to it after a few weeks.

I also recorded a new version of my [modular jam from last week](https://vimeo.com/215450266). After posting the video, I realized that one of the voices was out of tune! I almost let it go but just really wasn't content, hence the new version. This version has a better arrangement, too. (Though, I did mess up a bit toward the end.)

Last night I hosted a **[Ninjam](http://www.cockos.com/ninjam/)** jam, where I live-patched my modular (and played bass) with four other people from the **[Disquiet Junto](https://disquiet.com/)** Slack group. The participants were playing from different parts of the US, and one from the UK. It was the first ever jam for the group, and everyone had great fun. As a testament to that, it lasted some 3 hours! I recorded the entire session, and one of the participants was kind enough to upload it to his Soundcloud:
