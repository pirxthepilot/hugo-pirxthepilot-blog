I was away on vacation most of last week and so could not do the usual weekly proclivities. So instead, I tried to learn some live coding with **[Tidal Cycles](https://tidalcycles.org/)**. I meant record a tune out of it, but just did not have the time to complete one.

Here's an attempt for an arpeggiated synth bit based on the **[Stranger Things](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4574334/)** theme:

And another, testing sampling capabilities:

Live coding has opened up a lot of new avenues for me to explore. I'm ecstatic to have started learning it, and wish I'd have tried it much sooner. Looking forward to making more music with it!
