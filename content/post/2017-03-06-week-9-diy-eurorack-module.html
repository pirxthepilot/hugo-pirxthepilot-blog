title = "Week 9: DIY Eurorack Module"
+++
<p>Against wise advice, I went ahead and purchased PCB, panels and components for the DIY module <b>Ornament and Crime</b>Â (<a href="http://ornament-and-cri.me">http://ornament-and-cri.me</a>). The functionality of this module and the challenges involved is just too hard to resist. Not only is it my first modular DIY build, it is also my first involving surface mount components!</p><p>That took a bit of getting used to. At this point I am pretty OK with the 0805s, but still awkward with the chips and anything that has more than 2 legs. While my soldering job is quite ugly, I was quite lucky that there were no catastrophic mistakes.</p><p>I got a DIY bench power supply for Eurorack which I will use to test the voltages. So far I have already completed soldering the ICs and passives. I am also waiting for a few other components to arrive, namely the OLED and Teensy.</p><figure data-orig-width="683" data-orig-height="1024" class="tmblr-full"><img src="https://68.media.tumblr.com/9a9eb65f79ec4b716d421573c17d49a9/tumblr_inline_omdcbr6M7y1sqvj59_540.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="683" data-orig-height="1024"/></figure><figure data-orig-width="683" data-orig-height="1024" class="tmblr-full"><img src="https://68.media.tumblr.com/50edf9f36e0d5666e637f05911127bde/tumblr_inline_omdcc0Onvn1sqvj59_540.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="683" data-orig-height="1024"/></figure><p>Extra photo to highlight the single most terrifying soldering job of the build - the ultra-tiny DAC!</p><figure data-orig-width="683" data-orig-height="1024" class="tmblr-full"><img src="https://68.media.tumblr.com/8b8e96eb35a5171282e476514995d00b/tumblr_inline_omdcdiEKZi1sqvj59_540.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="683" data-orig-height="1024"/></figure><p>

While this project is on hold, I have started on a new one: the relatively simple <a href="http://www.synthrotek.com/products/modular-circuits/rnd/"><b>Synthrotek RND</b></a>. More on that next week.
