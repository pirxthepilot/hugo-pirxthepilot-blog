Recorded a live jam of the patch I was working on from 2 weeks back. The main synth loops and bass are from the [Aalto](http://madronalabs.com/products/aalto) softsynth, and the rest are modular.

This set is a combination of hardware and loops in Ableton, so I had the idea of hooking up my trusty old Akai LPD8 so I can mute/unmute tracks. A lot of processing is also done in Ableton - some reverb, lots of compression.
