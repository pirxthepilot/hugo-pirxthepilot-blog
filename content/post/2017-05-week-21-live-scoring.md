Not a significantly productive week last week compared with previous ones, but aside from a few modular patch attempts, I participated in a live scoring Ninjam session with my usual group last weekend. We scored Luis Bu√±uel and Salvador Dali's ***[Un Chien Andalou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Un_Chien_Andalou)*** (An Andalusian Dog), a surrealist short film from 1929.

I prepared my modular patch for this scoring work a few hours before the actual jam. I was going for some weird, dissonant atmospheric sounds that is very different from the sounds I usually aim for. Nevertheless, it was a very rewarding experience!

We did two takes, each sounding different from the other. Videos below.
